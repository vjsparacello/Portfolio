<h1>Greetings! I am Vincent, a Cybersecurity Professional. Welcome to my portfolio. </h1>

</h2> As a dedicated cybersecurity professional with a robust background in IT and system administration, I am driven by a passion for protecting digital landscapes and fortifying network defenses. Currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity, I am committed to staying at the forefront of industry advancements and continuously expanding my knowledge base.

My professional journey is marked by a diverse array of industry certifications, including CompTIA's A+, Security+, IT Fundamentals, EC-Council's Certified Ethical Hacker, a Dell certification, and HDI Support Center Analyst for professional soft skills. These certifications reflect my comprehensive understanding of both technical and soft skills essential for effective cybersecurity practices.

I have had the critical experience of working at a location hit by ransomware, where I was tasked with the recovery and clean-up process. This hands-on experience has deepened my understanding of the immediate and strategic responses necessary to mitigate such attacks and restore system integrity.

To further hone my skills, I utilize platforms such as Hack The Box, TryHackMe, and VulnHub to explore various vectors, techniques, and exploits. Additionally, I have completed the CrowdStrike University LP-L (LogScale) and LP-H Threat Hunter courses, reinforcing my knowledge in advanced threat detection and response.

I am particularly enthusiastic about the concept of purple teaming, which synergizes offensive and defensive strategies to create a resilient cybersecurity framework. Embracing the mindset of "to beat a hacker, you must think like a hacker," I strive to anticipate and counteract cyber threats proactively. My approach combines rigorous analysis with innovative problem-solving to ensure robust security measures.

To stay at the cutting edge of the industry, I regularly attend prestigious conventions such as the DEF CON hacking convention in Las Vegas and Fal.Con for CrowdStrike. Additionally, I engage in numerous webinars and continued learning opportunities to keep my skills sharp and informed by the latest developments in cybersecurity.

With a proven track record in safeguarding systems and a continuous drive to excel, I am committed to making a significant impact in the field of cybersecurity. I am eager to contribute my expertise and collaborate with like-minded professionals. </h2>
